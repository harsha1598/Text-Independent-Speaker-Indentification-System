# Text-Independent-Speaker-Indentification-System
Speaker-Indentification System based on **GMM** model.

## The theoretical part is bascially based on  
***Robust Text-Independent Speaker Identification Using Gaussian Mixture Speaker Models*** by D.A. Reynolds in Lincoln Lab., MIT, Lexington, MA, USA and R.C. Rose
